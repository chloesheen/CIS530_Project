# Code

All of our code are self-contained in individual Jupyter notebooks. Each
notebook is named after the experiment it runs.

* For BERT experiments: `BERT_experiments.ipynb`
* For End-to-end embedding and classification experiments:
`End_to_end_experiments.ipynb`
* For Seperate embedding and classification experiments:
`BERT_BOW_SEPERATE_EMBEDDINGS_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`
* For Random Forest and XGBoost experiments:
`BERT_BOW_RF_XGB_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`

Note:some notebooks will require changing of file locations. (To access data go up one directory!)
